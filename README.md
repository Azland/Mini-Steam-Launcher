I believe the initial version of this skin was first created by "BushTiger" on DeviantArt: https://www.deviantart.com/bushtiger/art/Steam-Mini-Launcher-1-0-634401069. There have been other 2.x and 3.x versions floating around, fixing various things. I've therefore started this at version 4.0 as a non-official continuation of this skin, which seems to have been abandoned. 

The skin has been broken by a number of updates to how Steam are handling their profile data. In 2023, even with a fully "public" profile, it is not possible to view recent games by user without either logging in, or having an API key. For this reason, I've altered the skin to use the "top 3" recent games which steam does display on public profiles. The skin therefore lacks features compared to older versions, but this is the only publicly available data which can be used.
